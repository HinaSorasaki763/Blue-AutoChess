這是一款"絕對不會營利"的蔚藍檔案二創遊戲，其美術資源多數從蔚藍檔案本體拆包而成，少數由@WhatIsThisG 提供的素材而成，目前處於半成品，尤其是美術資源以及特效方面特別匱乏。

以下是幾張遊戲內截圖，可以看出目前美術資源的匱乏，但遊戲本體的邏輯已經架構完畢:

This is a “definitely non-commercial” Blue Archive fan game. Most of the art assets were extracted from the original Blue Archive game, with some materials provided by @WhatIsThisG. It’s currently in a half-finished state, especially lacking in art assets and special effects.

Below are a few in-game screenshots, which clearly show how limited the art assets currently are. However, the core game logic is already in place.
